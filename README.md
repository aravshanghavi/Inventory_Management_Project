## Overview
This project implements an automated inventory management system for electronic components using computer vision and natural language processing. It allows users to easily track and update inventory by simply uploading images of circuit elements.

## Features
- Image-based inventory tracking
- Real-time object detection of electronic components
- Natural language generation for inventory updates
- User-friendly web interface
- Support for both borrowing and returning items

## Technologies Used
- **Frontend**: Streamlit
- **Object Detection**: YOLOv5 (Ultralytics)
- **Natural Language Processing**: OpenAI GPT-3
- **Image Processing**: Pillow
- **Deep Learning Framework**: PyTorch

## Model Training
The object detection model was custom-trained on a dataset of electronic components using YOLOv5.
